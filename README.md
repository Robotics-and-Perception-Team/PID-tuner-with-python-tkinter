# PID-tuner-with-python-tkinter

Before starting the code, you have to learn bus adress of your MCU. We used stm32f1 as an MCU in this project.

After that, you only need to write python PID_tuner_Tkinter.py to the CMD and it starts communcation.

Don't forget to press arm-disarm button before you send new PID commands.
